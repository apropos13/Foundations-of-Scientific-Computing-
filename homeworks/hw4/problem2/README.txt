For this question I have included all parts a,b,c and d into one file 
twice.py. Since part b,c,d all build on part a I have not included the 
exact code for part (a) in the twice.py file. But, for the part (a),
I have tested the function as defined in the exercise and I see that 
python prints twice the string 'spam'.
