Since I am not able to write functions in the cshrc file I swithced to using bash shell instead. Therefore, 
since I am working on my local machine running iOs i editted the bash_profile file

The function that I wrote is:

function pwd_up() {                                                                                                                                                                                             
    parent=$PWD #Define parent to the current directory                                                                                                                                                         
    for n in $(seq $1)                                                                                                                                                                                          
    do                                                                                                                                                                                                          
        parent=$(dirname $parent) #go up until necessairy level                                                                                                                                                 
    done

    ls $parent #output ls

alias 'pwd..'='pwd_up'
