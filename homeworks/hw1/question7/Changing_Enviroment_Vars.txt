Since i am usin the school's server riverdance which runs on Centos I had to change my ~/.cshrc file instead of the 
.bashrc file. I create the MY_PATH variable by using the command:

set MY_PATH = (~/ams209/ams209/homeworks/)

Then I also used the following alias:

alias lsc 'ls --color'


Now when typing lsc we see different colors for files and directories.
