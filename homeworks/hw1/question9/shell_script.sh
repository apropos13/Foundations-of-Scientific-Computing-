By typing:

chmod a+x README.sh

I see that we give execution permission for all users (me, group and others). 
Also by typing ls now I see a different color than what a normal (non executable)
file would have.

Since we are using '#!/bin/bash/more' we see that when we execute the script, the
file appears on the terminal (since the more command is executed).
